# Getting started
We have three <div> elements that we are going to mess around with today and tomorrow. I will teach you the Box Model, how margins and padding work, borders, background, fonts, and flexbox- the (deposed)king of the Mobile Web!

# Notes

    Box Model: The box model applies to (nearly) all HTML elements that you will use and create. When it doesn't apply, you can FORCE the box model into compliance with a bit of CSS. So what is the box model? 

    You can read about it here: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp

    Or you can play along with me and learn by doing, your choice. Let's open up our index.html file and get started. 

# Easy way to remember the Box Model
    You pad your content so that it doesn't get hurt crashing into the border. You add margins so your elements don't collide. 

# Things the Box Model can do
    You can adjust any aspect of the Box. If you need a margin on top, so be it. Need padding only on the left or right? No sweat. When adjusting any feature of the box, you can shortcut following  "top-right-bottom-left". This includes borders, radius values, etc. If it applies to the box model, it is top-right-bottom-left.

    You *can* use pixel values, but it is better to use percentage, viewport height (vh), viewport width (vw), rem, or em [more on these later]. Values that you *can* use but shouldn't: pt, cw, ch




# IDs and Classes
- a way to select one or more elements by attribute value
- id is unique, can only be used once on a single page
- classes identify one or more elements that have a shared class name
    - these do not have to be the same type of element

# Exercise 
Using the index.html file 
    - Read through the index file and open it in your browser. Follow the instructions within the various elements
